## Overview

The Context-Driven Engineering Learning Framework is a structured pedagogical architecture designed to integrate decision-context reasoning into engineering management education.

Version 1.0 establishes the baseline instructional architecture for contextual decision integration within undergraduate engineering programs.

---

## Purpose of Version 1.0

This release formalizes:

- Context-trigger instructional activation
- Stakeholder mapping structure
- Constraint identification layer
- Trade-off evaluation protocol
- Reflective justification model
- Outcome-Based Education alignment

This version serves as the foundational implementation specification.

## Core Instructional Architecture

The framework operates through a five-stage cycle:

1. Context Trigger Activation  
2. Stakeholder Identification and Mapping  
3. Constraint Structuring  
4. Trade-off Evaluation  
5. Reflective Decision Justification  

Each stage is modular and adaptable across management-oriented engineering courses.
